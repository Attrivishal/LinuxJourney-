# print all the odd numbers from 1 to 100

for i in {1..100..2}
do
  echo $i   
done


# what is happeing here
# here we are using for loop to iterate the sequence of number from 1 to 100 with a step of 2 , it means will print every number starting from one and 2 is added to the previous number so that only odd numbers are printed.
