📖 CHAPTER 1: Operating System Basics
What is an Operating System?
An OS is system software that acts as a bridge between computer hardware and users/applications.

Real-life Analogy: Restaurant Manager

Hardware = Kitchen equipment

Applications = Customers ordering food

OS = Restaurant manager who coordinates everything

Key Responsibilities:
Resource Manager: Allocates CPU time, RAM, disk space

Process Manager: Runs and manages programs

Memory Manager: Handles RAM allocation

File System Manager: Organizes files on storage

Device Manager: Controls hardware (keyboard, mouse, printer)

Security Manager: User permissions and protection

Why Do We Need an OS?
Without OS: You'd need to write code for every hardware operation
With OS: Simple commands do complex tasks

Example:

bash
# Without OS: Write assembly code to read disk sectors
# With OS: Simple command
cat document.txt
Types of Operating Systems:
bash
1. Desktop OS:     Windows, macOS, Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora)
2. Server OS:      Linux (CentOS, Ubuntu Server), Windows Server
3. Mobile OS:      Android (Linux-based), iOS
4. Embedded OS:    Routers, IoT devices, ATMs
